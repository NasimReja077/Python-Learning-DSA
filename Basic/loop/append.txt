The .append() method:
.append() is a built-in list method in Python

It adds a single element to the end of a list

Think of it like "attaching" or "adding" an item to the end of a list

It modifies the list in-place (doesn't create a new list)

Why use .append()?

It's the most efficient way to add single elements to a list

It modifies the list directly (in-place operation)

It's more memory efficient than creating new lists

It's the most readable and commonly used method

It's faster than using += or + for adding single elements

Think of .append() like adding a new car to a parking lot - you're just putting it in the next available space at the end of the lot, rather than creating a whole new parking lot with all the old cars plus the new one.
